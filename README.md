## How to change input
The input for the algorithm is the variable `bookBasket` inside de index.js file.

The input is an array of arrays. The first value of each inner array is the **book number** and the second value is the **number of copies** of the book.

### Example

```
let bookBasket = [[1, 2], 
                  [3, 5],
                  [5, 7]];
```

This means book 1 has two copies, book 3 has five copies and book 5 has seven copies.

### Extra info
There are some `console.log()` calls throughout the code that help understand how the input is processed. They are all commented. If needed, uncomment all of them.
