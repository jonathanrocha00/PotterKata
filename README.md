# WhyAmITheOne
Go on, go on, go on
If you're thinking that the worst is yet to come
Why am I the one always packing up my stuff?
For once, for once, for once
I get the feeling that I'm right where I belong
Why am I the one always packing up my stuff?
I think I kinda like it
But I might have had too much
